Europe TOP league Predictability


Data Source

From Kaggle’s recently published European Soccer Database, I used top 6 European soccer leagues’ match data from seasons 2008/2009 to 2015/2016.Those leagues are England Premier League, France Ligue 1, Germany Bundesliga, Italy Serie A,  Portugal Primeira Liga,and Spain La Liga. Variables that are used to examine match predictability include match id, league name, country name, season, home team name, away team name and betting decimal odds given by Bet365.

Use Entropy to Measure Predictability

Based on Information Theory, Shannon’s Entropy(H) can be used to measure the uncertainty of an event’s outcome.
